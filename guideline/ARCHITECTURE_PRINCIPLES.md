# 🧱 Architecture & Principles

## Clean Architecture

## SOLID Principles:

**S — SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)** → One reason to change per class/function.  
(Keywords: cohesion, maintainability, clarity, modularity).

**O — OCP (Open/Closed Principle)** → Open for extension, closed for modification.  
(Keywords: strategy pattern, plug-in, extensibility).

**L — LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)** → Subclasses should fully replace base classes without altering behavior.  
(Keywords: inheritance integrity, contract consistency).

**I — ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)** → Prefer many small, focused interfaces.  
(Keywords: decoupling, minimal API, specialization).

**D — DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)** → Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.  
(Keywords: inversion of control, ports/adapters, decoupling, testability).

**DI (Dependency Injection)** → Inject dependencies instead of creating them directly.  
(Keywords: IoC container, inversion of control, testability, mocking, loose coupling).

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** → Prioritize clarity, readability, and simplicity over over-engineering.  
(Keywords: maintainability, minimalism, cognitive load, clean code).

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** → Eliminate duplicated logic; centralize shared code in reusable modules or utilities.  
(Keywords: reusability, abstraction, single source of truth, consistency).
